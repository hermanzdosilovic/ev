Smart tool for task testing in Competitive Programming.

Tutorial - How to use it?
--------------
`ev` is a smart script can do a lot for you. To give you idea of how it works I prepared a short tutorial for you. I really recommend you to go thru this tutorial.

###Get the tutorial

1. You need to install `ev`. Follow [install instructions](https://github.com/hermanzdosilovic/ev#how-to-install-and-get-updates).
2. In your ev project folder open `tutorial` folder.
3. Open `start.txt` file and follow instructions.

How to install and get updates
------------------------------

Basic idea of instalation is being able to run `ev` in every directory from your terminal.
So basicly you need to copy or link `ev` script in some directory that is in your `$PATH` environmental variable, for example `/usr/local/bin/`.

###Install

Choose any directory in which you will keep this project. In that directory execute these commands: 
	
	$ git clone git@github.com:hermanzdosilovic/ev.git
	$ cd ev
	$ sudo chmod +x ev
	$ sudo ln -s $(pwd)/ev /usr/local/bin/ev

###Get updates
	
In `ev` project directory execute this command:
	
	$ git pull origin master
		

How to run
----------
You always run `ev` the same way.
	
	$ ev
	
And that is the beauty of it. Enjoy :)
