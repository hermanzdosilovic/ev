Hi,
in this tutorial I will try to teach you how does ev work. Lets start.

If you still haven't, install ev on your computer.
Follow these instructions to do that:
https://github.com/hermanzdosilovic/ev#how-to-install-and-get-updates

Open this tutorial folder in your terminal, we will do all the work here. Every
time I say you to run ev, you are running it from this folder.

Tutorial consists of 8 lessons.

OK, First thing that we will learn is how to run ev. You run ev by typing 'ev'
in your terminal (don't do it yet). And it is that simple. Every time you run it
the same way.

ev knows how to work with .c, .cpp, .rb and .py files. And every time you run ev
it looks for last modified file and uses that file to work with. Let me show you
what i mean by that. Please open basic.c file and follow instructions there.
