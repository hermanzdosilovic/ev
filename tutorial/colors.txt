By default ev is not using colorized output, but you can tell him to use it.

Its simple. ev is looking for environment variable $EVC. If value of $EVC is
'true' ev will use colorized output.

You can set this variable in many ways. If you wish it to be permanent you can
write following command in your ~/.profile script:

  export EVC=true

You can use any other script that sets this variable automaticly for you.


Or you can type this command directly in your console and you will have
colorized output for that console session.

Once when you have this variable you can do things like this:
  $ EVC=true
  $ ev
  $ EVC=false
  $ ev

Basicly you can toggle between colorized output.
